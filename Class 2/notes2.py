# CLASS 2: BASIC SCRIPTING NOTES

# PRINT STATEMENTS
"""
Let's start by writing some very basic python. in today's esson i will go through print sttements, commenting, variables, and data types
print statements are how you print something out for you to see
a famous first line of code to write is printing out the sentence "hello world"
"""
print("hello world")
# TRY PRINTING SOMETHING OUT AND RUNNING YOUR PROGRAM # IN ANSWERS2.py

"""
you can print numbers too! if you want try printing out your age
there's also a quick shortcut for printint out multiple things
"""


# COMMENTING
"""
comments are lines that are only meant for humans to read. they're ignored by the computer
comments are useful to put in directions or reminders for you for what each part did

# <-- single line comment
multiline is with three double quotes at the beginning and end
"""

# VARIABLES
"""
variables are containers that store data or information
you can basically name a variable whatever you want (except there are some reserved python that you can't use),
but make your names descriptive so that we know what it refers to
variables can hold lots of different types of stuff, but there are four simple types that are built-in to python
fir st let's make a variable and talk about how to use it

how to make a variable:
variablename = value

age = 16

print(17)
print("i am", 17)
print("my age is", 17)
print("my last birthday i turned", 17)
print("people my age are", 17)
"""
age = 17
print(age)
print("i am", age)
print("my age is", age)
print("my last birthday i turned", age)
print("people my age are", age)

# PRACTICE: i want you to create a variable and practice printing it out

# DATA TYPES
"""
1. integer: used to describe any whole number; the age variable we made before is an integer
2. float: used to describe any decimal
3. boolean: it only has two possible values, either True or False
4. string: any collection of alphabets or characters, used for letters, words, sentences; denoted with single or double quotes
    when you start a string, you have to end it as well

let's make some variables of each type
"""

# integer values
favoriteNum = 343
grade = 12

# float
pi = 3.14
e = 2.718

# boolean variables
python = True
java = False

# string
name = "suhani"
sentence = "this is a whole sentence and a very long string"

# TRY THIS! MAKE YOUR OWN VARIABLES OF EACH TYPE

"""
notice that when you are making variables, you don't have to explicitly say what type you want
python knows what data type the variables are when you make them based on the characteristics of each type

"""

randomNum = "1934" # what data type is randomNum? put your answer in the chat
