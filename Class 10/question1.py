# QUESTION ONE
"""
Given a list of numbers and a number k, determine if there are three entries in the list which add up to the specified number k. 
For example, given [20, 303, 3, 4, 25] and k = 49, return true because 20 + 4 + 25 = 49.
If there is no such combination of three numbers, return false.

hint: think about nested loops.
