# QUESTION 1: write a program that uses a loop to take a list of keys and a list of values and 
# combine them into a dictionary.
keys = ["name", "age", "grade", "school"]
values = ["suhani", 16, 12, "hths"]
# expected output: personalInfo = {"name":"suhani", "age":16, "grade": 12, "school": "hths"}

# QUESTION 2: write a program that prints all the keys and values of only the unique values in the dictionary.
favoriteColor = {"suhani":"blue", "didi":"pink", "mausam":"red", "priya":"blue", "mom":"red", "dad":"orange", "nina":"purple"}
# expected output: (because blue and red are repeated values)
#   didi pink
#   dad orange
#   nina purple

# SOME EXTRA LIST QUESTIONS
# QUESTION 3: write a program to get the smallest item in an unsorted list.
listTwo = [13,4,8,2,10]

# QUESTION 4: write a program to make a new list which contains only the unique values 
# in the original one.
listThree = [1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,3,3,3,3,3,3,4,4,4,5,5,5,5,5,5,5]
# sampleOutput = [1,2,3,4,5]
